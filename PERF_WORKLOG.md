# Perf Worklog

Start: 2026-02-03

Goal: Identify and implement 30%+ speedup for IPS or video rendering, with instrumentation that guides micro-optimizations.

## CPU Opcode Sampling

### 2026-02-03

Changes:
- Wired the existing CPU profiler into the emulator loop.
- Enabled opcode sampling and periodic reporting.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/newcpu.cpp`
  - Added `PROF_OPCODE_SAMPLE(opcode)` in the hot CPU loop.
  - Uses `prof_record_opcode()` (sampled) to populate top-opcode stats.
- `src/basilisk/main_esp32.cpp`
  - Added `cpu_profiler_init(...)` during setup.
  - Added `cpu_profiler_report()` in `basilisk_loop()`.
  - Default enable macro: `CPU_PROFILER_DEFAULT_ENABLED` (defaults to `1`, can override via build flags).

Notes:
- The profiler already implements a sampled top-opcode list (32 slots) and prints the top 10 every 5 seconds when enabled.
- Overhead is expected (~5-10%). This is acceptable for profiling and can be disabled once optimizations are done.

Next:
- Capture first 60 seconds of boot with profiler enabled.
- Extract top opcodes and map them to their handlers in `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/generated/cpuemu.cpp`.
- Identify hot instructions with heavy memory or flag logic and micro-optimize them.

## Video Rendering

### 2026-02-03 (initial review)

Observations:
- Tile-based rendering with dirty tracking is already active.
- DMA-based display writes are used; streaming path is disabled.
- Perf counters exist for detect/render timing.

Hypotheses for wins:
- Reduce per-tile overhead in `renderTile*` paths (tighten loops, eliminate redundant bounds checks).
- Explore wider DMA chunking or batching to reduce `setAddrWindow` calls.
- Evaluate partial update policy thresholds for full vs partial refresh.
- Consider direct panel writes bypassing some M5GFX wrappers if they add overhead.

Next:
- Add a light breakdown of render cost (tile conversion vs DMA wait) if needed.
- Compare alternative tile sizes (larger tiles = fewer calls, smaller tiles = less overdraw).
- Investigate direct screen writes vs current library paths.

## Benchmarks

- Pending: CPU opcode sampling run (first 60 seconds from boot).
- Pending: Video perf run with the same window for apples-to-apples.

## Build/Run Notes

- Profiler default enabled: override with `-DCPU_PROFILER_DEFAULT_ENABLED=0` to disable.
- Logging target: capture serial for first 60 seconds from boot.


## WiFi Disabled for Perf Testing

### 2026-02-03

Reason:
- Device was auto-connecting to an SSID that is not available, which adds delays and noise to boot logs during perf runs.

Change:
- Added compile-time switch to skip WiFi auto-connect during boot GUI.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/boot_gui.cpp`
  - `BOOTGUI_DISABLE_WIFI_AUTOCONNECT` (default `1`).
  - If auto-connect was enabled in settings, it is now skipped with a log message.

Notes:
- Re-enable by setting `-DBOOTGUI_DISABLE_WIFI_AUTOCONNECT=0` in build flags.

### 2026-02-03 (SSID not available handling)

Change:
- If auto-connect is enabled and the saved SSID is not found, auto-connect is disabled and settings are saved to stop repeated attempts.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/boot_gui.cpp`
  - On `WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL`, set `wifi_auto_connect = false`, call `saveSettings()`, and log.


## Opcode Sampling (lightweight ring buffer)

### 2026-02-03

Observation:
- Enabling the existing `cpu_profiler` caused a repeatable FreeRTOS assert on Core 1: `assert failed: xQueueSemaphoreTake queue.c:1709 (( pxQueue ))` immediately after CPU start.
- This prevented stable sampling runs.

Change:
- Replaced the hot-loop opcode sampling with a lightweight ring-buffer sampler that does not use the CPU profiler.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/opcode_sampler.h`
- `src/basilisk/opcode_sampler.cpp`
  - Samples every `OPCODE_SAMPLE_RATE` instructions.
  - Stores samples into a lock-free ring buffer.
  - Aggregates and prints Top 10 opcodes every 5 seconds in the main loop.
- `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/newcpu.cpp`
  - Replaced `PROF_OPCODE_SAMPLE` with `OPCODE_SAMPLE` using the new sampler.
- `src/basilisk/main_esp32.cpp`
  - Calls `opcode_sampler_report()` in `basilisk_loop()`.
  - Removed CPU profiler init/report calls to avoid the assert.

Next:
- Run a full 60-second capture and extract the top opcodes from the new sampler output.
- Map those opcodes to handlers in `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/generated/cpuemu.cpp` for micro-optimizations.

## Video Rendering: Row-Strip DMA Coalescing

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Reduce per-tile DMA overhead by coalescing contiguous dirty tiles into wider horizontal strips.
- This should lower `setAddrWindow` + `writePixelsDMA` call count, especially during large or full-screen updates.

Changes:
- Added optional row-strip buffers (double-buffered) and a strip-render path.
- Rendered tiles directly into a strided strip buffer, then pushed the entire strip with one DMA call.
- Kept per-tile DMA path as a fallback if row buffers cannot be allocated.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/video_esp32.cpp`
  - New config: `VIDEO_USE_ROW_STRIPS` (default `1`).
  - New buffers: `row_buffer_psram` + `row_buffer_enabled`.
  - New render helpers: `renderTileFromSnapshotStrided`, `renderTileFromFramebuffer8Strided`.
  - `renderAndPushDirtyTiles()` updated to coalesce dirty tiles into horizontal strips.
  - VideoInit allocates row-strip buffers and logs which memory they land in.

Notes:
- Strip buffer size: `DISPLAY_WIDTH * tile_pixel_height` pixels (1280 * 80) = 204,800 bytes.
- Double-buffered strip buffers total ~400KB; should fit in PSRAM.
- Expect biggest wins when many tiles in a row are dirty (e.g., large window moves, full-screen redraws).

Next:
- Upload and capture a 60s boot log to compare `[VIDEO PERF] avg render` vs baseline.
- If improvement is strong, consider increasing tile size or tuning row-strip vs per-tile threshold.

## CPU Loop Tuning: Larger Batch + Tick Quantum

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Reduce overhead from tick checks and special-flag polling by running larger instruction batches per loop.
- Decrease frequency of `basilisk_loop()` calls while still preserving overall timing via catch-up.

Changes:
- Increased `EXEC_BATCH_SIZE` in `newcpu.cpp` from 4096 to 8192.
- Increased `emulated_ticks_quantum` in `main_esp32.cpp` from 320000 to 640000.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/newcpu.cpp`
- `src/basilisk/main_esp32.cpp`

Next:
- Build + upload and capture a 60s boot log.
- Compare IPS and video metrics to baseline row-strip off build.

## Video Rendering: Larger Tiles (160x40)

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Reduce per-tile overhead by halving the number of tiles per frame (72 -> 36).

Changes:
- Increased `TILE_WIDTH` from 80 to 160 while keeping `TILE_HEIGHT` at 40.
- Tile grid now 4x9 (36 tiles total).

Code:
- `src/basilisk/video_esp32.cpp`

Next:
- Build + upload and capture a 60s boot log.
- Compare `[VIDEO PERF] avg render` vs baseline (80x40 tiles) for improvement.

### 2026-02-05 (Result)

- 160x40 tile size increased average render time vs 80x40 (~30% worse in first 60s sample).
- Reverted to 80x40 tiles.

### 2026-02-05 (Follow-up)

- Increased `EXEC_BATCH_SIZE` to 16384.
- Increased `emulated_ticks_quantum` to 1280000.
- Objective: further reduce overhead; validate IPS/video impact.

### 2026-02-05 (Result)

- `EXEC_BATCH_SIZE=16384` / `quantum=1.28M` did not improve average MIPS and worsened render time.

## Video Rendering: DSI Direct Framebuffer Path

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Bypass `M5.Display.writePixelsDMA()` on ESP32-P4 DSI and write directly into the DSI framebuffer.
- Flush cache via `panel->display(...)` for just the dirty region.

Changes:
- Added DSI detection and framebuffer pointer/stride capture from `Panel_DSI`.
- Added a DSI direct path that converts tiles to RGB565 (nonswapped) and blits them into the framebuffer.
- Added internal-rotation-aware blit logic to match M5GFX coordinate transforms.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/video_esp32.cpp`

Result (first ~60s from boot, 12 samples):
- Baseline log: `/tmp/pio_perf_nosampler_batch8192.log`
  - Avg render: ~862us
  - Avg IPS: ~1.533 MIPS
- DSI direct log: `/tmp/pio_perf_dsi_direct_60s.log`
  - Avg render: ~374us
  - Avg IPS: ~1.537 MIPS

Net:
- Video render time improved by ~56% vs baseline (substantial win).
- IPS unchanged (as expected; CPU core on separate core).

Notes:
- DSI framebuffer reported: `panel=720x1280`, `display=1280x720`, `internal rotation=3`.
- If any orientation glitches appear on hardware, we can adjust the rotation mapping in `dsi_blit_tile(...)`.

## Video Rendering: Frame Skipping (Whole-Frame) + Dirty Merge

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Avoid long render bursts during heavy UI updates (dragging windows, scrolling).
- Let the system “skip frames” at a whole-frame level (no partial tile chunking).

Changes:
- Disabled tile-level render budgeting by default (`VIDEO_RENDER_BUDGET_US=0`).
- Added whole-frame skip policy for heavy redraws:
  - `VIDEO_FRAME_MIN_MS` (normal) and `VIDEO_FRAME_MIN_HEAVY_MS` (heavy redraws).
  - `VIDEO_HEAVY_DIRTY_TILES` threshold to select the heavy interval.
- Dirty tiles are now merged (`dirty_tiles |= write_dirty_tiles`) instead of replaced.
- Rendered tiles explicitly clear their dirty bit; unrendered tiles persist into the next frame.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/video_esp32.cpp`

Next:
- Subjective test: verify that UI feels less “stuck” during heavy redraws without chunked tile updates.
- Reverted to `EXEC_BATCH_SIZE=8192`, `quantum=640k`.

## Video vs CPU Tradeoff: cpufunctbl in PSRAM

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Free internal SRAM for the Mac frame buffer (and tile buffers) to improve video render speed.

Changes:
- Added `CPUFUNCTBL_FORCE_PSRAM` to allocate `cpufunctbl` in PSRAM, freeing internal SRAM.
- This should allow the Mac frame buffer allocation to land in internal SRAM (faster read/write).

Code:
- `src/basilisk/uae_cpu/basilisk_glue.cpp`
- `platformio.ini` (`-DCPUFUNCTBL_FORCE_PSRAM=1`)

Next:
- Build + upload and capture a 60s boot log.
- Compare video render times vs baseline (sampler off, batch8192/quantum640k).

## CPU Loop: Throttled taskYIELD

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Reduce context-switch overhead from yielding every `basilisk_loop()`.

Change:
- Added `BASILISK_YIELD_STRIDE` (default 16) to yield every N loop iterations instead of every loop.

Code:
- `src/basilisk/main_esp32.cpp`

Next:
- Build + upload and capture a 60s boot log to measure IPS/video impact.

### 2026-02-05 (Result)

- Forcing `cpufunctbl` into PSRAM allowed the Mac frame buffer to allocate in internal SRAM, but overall video render time and MIPS both regressed.
- Reverted to internal `cpufunctbl` (default).

### 2026-02-05 (Result)

- Throttling `taskYIELD()` (every 16 loops) slightly reduced MIPS and worsened render time.
- Reverted to yielding every loop.

## Opcode Sampling (Hot Opcode List)

### 2026-02-05

Run:
- Captured 60s boot log with opcode sampler enabled.
- Log: `/tmp/pio_perf_opcode_sampler_boot60s.log`

Top opcodes aggregated across samples:
- `4E75` (RTS)
- `B0B8` (CMP.L (xxx).W,Dn)
- `6EFA` (BGT short)
- `6704` (BEQ short)
- `642C` (BCC short)
- `60F0` (BRA short)
- `B3D6`
- `D3C1`
- `4A11`
- `2229`
- Plus frequent DBcc variants (`51C9`, `51CC`, `57CC`) and `MOVEQ` (`7000`)

Notes:
- Branch/DBcc opcodes dominate samples, suggesting branch handling overhead is significant.
- The sampler ring buffer dropped samples during heavy periods, so counts are approximate.

## CPU Fast-Path Attempt (Branch/DBcc/Link/Unlk)

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Avoid function-pointer dispatch for extremely hot branch and frame-setup opcodes.

Changes:
- Added optional fast-path handlers in `newcpu.cpp` for:
  - Short Bcc/BRA (existing)
  - DBcc (decrement-and-branch)
  - LINK/UNLK
  - RTS/NOP/MOVEQ (existing)
- Enabled via `FAST_OPCODE_PATH=1` in build flags.

Result:
- Perf regressed. 60s boot log (`/tmp/pio_perf_fastpath_boot60s.log`) averaged:
  - IPS: ~1.43 MIPS (vs ~1.92 MIPS baseline with sampler off)
  - Video render avg: ~0.78 ms (roughly unchanged)
- Conclusion: The per-opcode fast-path checks add more overhead than they remove on this target.

Action:
- Disabled `FAST_OPCODE_PATH` (kept the code gated for future experiments).

## Video: Direct Bus DMA Writes (Bypass M5GFX Pixelcopy)

### 2026-02-05

Goal:
- Reduce video render overhead by bypassing M5GFX `writePixelsDMA` (which copies
  into an internal DMA buffer via `pixelcopy_t`), and instead write our already
  swap565-formatted buffers directly to the bus DMA.

Changes:
- Added a direct-bus write path in `renderAndPushDirtyTiles()`:
  - Use `M5.Display.getPanel()->getBus()` and `bus->writeBytes(...)` for DMA-capable buffers.
  - Fallback to `M5.Display.writePixelsDMA()` if the buffer isn't DMA-capable.
  - `waitDisplayDMA()` now waits on the bus directly when available.

Results (60s boot window):
- Baseline (sampler off, batch 8192, quantum 640k, row strips off):
  - Render avg ~775 us
  - IPS avg ~1.92 MIPS
- Direct bus DMA path:
  - Render avg ~49 us
  - IPS avg ~1.95 MIPS

Log:
- `/tmp/pio_perf_directbus_boot60s.log`

Important correction:
- The ESP32-P4 display uses a DSI bus (`bus_dsi`). On DSI, `IBus::writeBytes()`
  is a no-op (Bus_ImagePush), so the direct-bus path produced a black screen.
- I added a guard: direct bus DMA is now used only for `bus_spi` and `bus_parallel*`.
  DSI falls back to `M5.Display.writePixelsDMA()` to keep the display working.
- The big render win above is therefore not applicable on DSI hardware.
